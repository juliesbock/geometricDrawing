# Geometric Art

Geometric Art is an app that allows users to make and save drawings online. Unlike most drawing platforms, this web app allows users to draw only on a strict grid. This allows folks who are more linear-minded or left-brained to enjoy creating geometric art.

## Features 

Geometric Art runs on HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. It includes algorithms to adapt user actions to a strict grid pattern. The application is interactive in realtime through the use of event listeners and image capture functionality. Files are modularized by implementing Webpack and Node Modules (npm).

## Future Features 

  - Adjustable size circles
  - Variable line types (dashed, dotted, etc)
  - Undo and redo capability
  - Cleaner eraser functionality
